NOLA.shp is derived from the New Orleans boundary shapefile available from https://data.nola.gov/Geographic-Reference/NOLA-Boundary/2b2j-u6kh. It has been transformed to a NAD83 unprojected coordinate system, and the polygons unioned so that there is only one boundary polygon.

The roads layer comes from OpenStreetMap. See https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright for more info.
