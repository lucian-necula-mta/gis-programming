<dd>

The 2006 Second Edition  TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected
geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER
database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is
a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area
based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The
Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no
overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based
TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data
set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The
2006 Second Edition  TIGER/Line files consist of line segments
representing physical features and governmental and statistical
boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series
of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19
record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate
points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate
software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in
the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census
feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types,
address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical
entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,
landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.

The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major
types of features/entities;
Line Features -
(1) Roads
(2) Railroads
(3) Hydrography
(4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines
and pipe lines
(5) Legal (governmental unit) and statistical boundaries
Landmark Features -
(1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; sporadic coverage
added on an as-needed basis
(2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries; sporadic coverage
added on an as-needed basis
Polygon features -
(1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census
2000 census statistical data and governmental unit boundaries
legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation
Survey (BAS)
(2) Locations of area landmarks
The line features and polygon information form the majority of
data in the TIGER/Line files.  Some of the data/attributes
describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers
(names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable
characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic
entity codes.  The Census Bureau includes landmark features
on an as-needed-basis and has made no attempt to ensure that
all instances of a particular landmark feature were included.
The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that
describe landmark features and provide locational reference.
Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature
Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.
The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects
(points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world
geography.  The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to
represent features such as streets, rivers, and political
boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify
and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market
Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the
Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information
from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically
consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by
the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census
TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent
area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
equivalent area is then distributed among 19 fixed length
record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either
line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census
Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature
and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate
updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous
version.

<ol>
<li><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><p>
Accurate against Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS),
FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes
and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been
examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><p>
The Census Bureau uses Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates
at road centerline intersections to evaluate the horizontal spatial
accuracy of source files that may be used to realign road features
in the TIGER database and test the horizontal spatial accuracy of
the road features in the TIGER/Line files.  The test compares a
survey-grade GPS coordinate to its associated road centerline
intersection in the TIGER file.  The test is based upon an
independent collection of GPS coordinates for a random sample of
road intersections from a centerline file that meet certain criteria.
The points are referred to as the sample points and are gathered
through a private contractor working for the Census Bureau.  Since
the collection method uses survey-quality GPS-based field techniques,
the resulting control points are considered &quot;ground truth&quot; against
which the TIGER road centerline intersection coordinates are compared.
The distances between the coordinates are calculated and the Census
Bureau determines the Circular Error 95% (CE95).  That is, the accuracy
of the file in meters with 95% confidence.  The CE95 can be calculated
from the mean and standard deviation by using the formula: mean of
differences plus (2.65 times the standard deviation).
CE95 results reported for each file tested are determined using a
spreadsheet with embedded statistical formula.  The use and
applicability of the spreadsheet and its embedded formula have been
verified by Census Bureau statisticians.  The basis of the calculation
is the use of the root mean square error (RSME).  This is the method as
stated in the U.S. Government's Federal Geographic Data Committee
Standard FGDC-STD-007.3-1998, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards.
Part 3: National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy.  The results of
using this measure of accuracy are in compliance with Federal Spatial
Data requirements.
In terms of the Census Bureau application, the dataset coordinate values
are those taken from the centerline file and the coordinate values from
an independent source of higher accuracy are those acquired through the
Census Bureau's contractor.
Please note that the horizontal spatial accuracy, where reported, refers
only to the realigned road features identified as matched to the
positionally accurate source file with that accuracy.  It is not the
spatial accuracy of the TIGER/Line file as a whole.

Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the
Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (2006 Second
Edition version) were created.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><p>
The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)
is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong
to the &quot;Geometry and Topology&quot; (GT) class of objects in the &quot;Spatial
Data Transfer Standard&quot; (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are
topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology GT-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
requirements.  These requirements include:
(1) Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
(2) Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
(3) Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
(4) Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain
element and are consistent throughout the extract process.
(5) The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.
The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical
consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update
System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census
TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for
states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American
Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts
are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed
spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the
compilation of the original Census TIGER database files.  Most of the
codes for all geographic entities except states, counties, and
congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS,
the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute
information has been examined but has not been fully tested for
consistency.
